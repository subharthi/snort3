 * @brief  generate a snort event
 *
 * This is a wrapper around SetEvent,CallLogFuncs,CallEventFuncs
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   10/31/05 - Marc Norton
 *   Changes to support every event being controlled via a rule.
 *   Modified GenerateSnortEvent() to re-route events to 'fpLogEvent'
 *   if a suitable otn was found.  If no otn was found, than we do
 *   not log the event at all, as no rule was provided.
 *   Preprocessors are configured independently, and may detect
 *   an event, but the rule controls the alert/drop functionality.

 * SnortEventqAdd() and SnortEventLog() functions - whichalready  route the events to
 * the fpLogEvent()function.
