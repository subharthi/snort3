Implement a comprehensive performance collection, processing, and logging
facility.

There are two broad classes of statistics:  Basic packet processing
information and Flow statistics.

Basic performance statistics include items such as event counts, packet
counts, stream counts, dropped packet counter, processor load, etc.  The
Flow statistics count flows between IP addresses.

The general data flow is:

1. Process the relevant information from each packet as it's being
   inspected.  Increment local counters.

2. At a configured interval, process the counters into the statistics.

3. At same processing interval, Log these statistics to a file.

4. Switch to another log file for the next cycle.

The type of statistics collection/processing/logging is controlled via
configuration.

perf_monitor is implemented as a network_inspector to give it access to the
per-packet processing mechanism.  It doesn't perform inspection in the
broad sense, but rather collects and logs information.

Statistics gathering is performed by the PerfTracker classes.
Each class acts a seperate module for gathering the different forms of
statistics. The PerfTracker classes pass their data into one of formatter
classes, which in turn format the data for output to console or to disk.

Currently output formats are:

1. Human-readable text

2. CSV

Support for a FlatBuffers-based ouput format has been planned for future
releases.
